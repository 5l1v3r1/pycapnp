Welcome to capnp's documentation!
=================================

This is a python wrapping of the C++ implementation of the `Cap'n Proto <http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/>`_ library. Here is a description, quoted from its docs:
    
    Cap’n Proto is an insanely fast data interchange format and capability-based RPC system. Think JSON, except binary. Or think Protocol Buffers, except faster. In fact, in benchmarks, Cap’n Proto is INFINITY TIMES faster than Protocol Buffers.

The INFINITY TIMES faster part isn't so true for python, but in some simplistic benchmarks (available in the `benchmark directory of the repo <https://github.com/jparyani/capnpc-python-cpp/tree/master/benchmark>`_), capnp is 4x faster than the pure python Protocol Buffer library, and 2x faster than the C++ implementation.
